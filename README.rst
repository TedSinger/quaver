See quaver/pieces/example.py for more examples

**IMMEDIATE GOAL**

- A complete, flexible, and intuitive structure for representing and manipulating musical forms

**DISTANT GOALS**

- Output nice sound files and play them easily in a cross-platform way
- Parse and output other text-based music notations

**NON-GOALS**

- Make _quaver_ into an excellent music notation system
  Once _quaver_ has decent parsers for other notation systems, they will be the preferred entry points.
  Python syntax restrictions will always be a handicap compared to other notations. I think I've already gone overboard with operator-overloading
- Anything involving real-time audio
