**IMMEDIATE GOAL**
- A robust, flexible, and intuitive structure for representing and manipulating musical forms

**DISTANT GOALS**
- Parse and output other text-based music notations
- Output nice sound files

**NON-GOALS**
- Make _quaver_ into a excellent music notation system
- - Python syntax limitations will always be a handicap compared to other notations
- - Once _quaver_ has decent parsers, they will be the preferred entry point
-
